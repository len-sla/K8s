> <p>How Jina is helping in NLP and ML .<br>
It looks like a approch which was taken by team which is developing JINA has 
a future as it collects best from various fields to conquer ML and NLP field and especially neuronal based search solutions.
Supported by  by docker or kubernetes and recetly by JINAhub which like docker hub make good impresion . <br>
I try to check how modular easy and useful for me is this package

## 1.  Cross-modal search in google style write text get image

The input query and the output result can be two different data types in a cross-modal search, such as text and images. In this example, I  will look at a text-to-image search similar to Google Images, where you enter the description of the image you want to search, and the output is a number of similar imageserybody has lot of differen pictures from smartfone cameras and other devices and posiiblity to index them automatically or temptation of simple searchig not by file name but by content is very high.

This requires  t match embedings of text and pictures to be compared . In this case, pre-trained cross-modal models could do that.

Ready to use [jupyter notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jina-ai/tutorial-notebooks/blob/main/Image_Search_via_Text.ipynb)  prepared by JINA team
